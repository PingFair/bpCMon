The bpCMon is a busines process compliance monitoring framework. Theoretically, it includes an event-based compliance specifying language (ECL) and rule based monitoring system, named as event reaction system (ERS).

This project is devoted to implement the bpCMon, with the purpose of making it applicable and efficent in BPM realistic setting. Its main components are, ECL modeler for specifying comliance rules, ERS monitor, and workingInterface for reading various events sources. 

For the current bpCMon, i.e., v 0.9.6, most of its componnets are implemented, including, its ECL modeler, ERS monitor, and the workingInterface for XES format source. In this repository, the bpCMon v0.9.6 could be downloaded and experienced based on an example project. 

However, the bpCMon now is still under extensively evaluation and optimization...
